Overview &#xA;&#xA;1.1 Overview of MX Component&#xA;&#xA;- MX Component is a tool designed to implement communication from a personal computer to the programmable controller without any knowledge of communication protocols and modules.&#xA;- Program development with serial communication and Ethernet communication used be complicated, however, it is simplified by using the common functions.&#xA;- When apply any of the following program examples to the actual system, examine the applicability and confirm that no problem will occur in the system control.&#xA;&#xA;1.2 Features&#xA;&#xA;Support of a wide range of communication paths for programmable controller&#xA;A wide range of communication paths to the programmable controller are supported to enable the user to configure up a system as desired.&#xA;&#xA;-Substantial improvement in user's development efficiency&#xA;MX Component comes with the wizard type Communication Setup Utility.&#xA;By Simply setting dialog-based communication settings on the screen, the user can achieve communication settings to access the programmable controller CPU to communicate with.&#xA;Once the communication setting are set, stations can be accessed by merely specifying the logical station number of the programmable controller CPU stored on Communication Setup Utility.&#xA;&#xA;-Save and read of communication settings.&#xA;MX Component features the functions to save and read the Communication Setup Utility.&#xA;The set data can easily be moved from the personal computer used for development to that used for operation.&#xA;MX Component must be installed in both the personal used for development and the actually used personal computer.&#xA;" VerticalAlignment="Top" Width="848" TextChanged="TextBox_TextChanged" Background="White" BorderBrush="White" IsEnabled="False" Focusable="False"/>
